## Our Journey

<details>
<summary>Day 1</summary>
On the 1st day we were given a detailed overview about the project and a figma wireframe with the webapp's design.

Our task was to create our own  Ai company and use the provided design to create our webapp.

So first day included figuring out the name of our app and what it would be about:
We decided to create a webapp related to the culinary field.
we decided to call our company AI Cooking Assistant.

Also we discussed how were going to approach the task, where we came to the conclusion that we would split the project into sections and create trello tickets for each task, as shown bellow.

### Trello Board

Already on the first day we implemented some of the amazing designs we had in mind.

With a mobile first approach, since we believe most of our users would use our app on the go.
(Eg busy person could look up a recipe on their way home and buy the ingredients before they get there.)

<summary>Day 3</summary>

On the 3rd day, we added a new page to our app that would provide users with information about our app and our team. Additionally, we created a products page to display a variety of dishes, complete with a star ratings system and prices. We also improved the design of the app to make it more user-friendly and visually appealing.
